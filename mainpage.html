    <div class="middle-box">
      <p> There are many different lengths of races.</p>

      <ul>
        <li> 5k (3.1 miles)</li>
          <ul class="sub-list">
            <li> Great race for beginners.</li>
            <li> Fun event, many include t-shirt and post-race party
                  that has live music, food and drinks!</li>
            <li> Average Cost $32.</li>
            <li> These races are in almost all cities, and very popular.</li>
          </ul>
        <li> 10k (6.2 miles)</li>
          <ul class="sub-list">
            <li> Great race for a challenge when experimenting with higher mileage.</li>
            <li> Average cost: $45. </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Quarter-Marathon (6.55 miles)</li>
          <ul class="sub-list">
            <li> Not the most popular race, but are many times associated
                with a full or half marathon.</li>
          </ul>
        <li> 15k (9.3 miles) </li>
          <ul class="sub-list">
            <li> Great race for people looking to add distance.</li>
            <li> Many times are paired with a 5K race.</li>
            <li> Example of a good event: <a href="https://www.hotchocolate15k.com/">
              Hot Chocolate 5k/15K </a>(with a great jacket- however beware the high entry fee) </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Half-Marathon (13.1 miles) </li>
          <ul class="sub-list">
            <li> Personal favorite race - great for long distance, but not super
               intense training, and you will be able to walk the next day.</li>
            <li> Training can take 3mo, but will not drastically change your
                  regular work/excercise/social routine.</li>
            <li> A sample training schedule is <a href="http://content.nike.com/content/dam/one-nike/en_us/season-2015-su/Running/NikeRunClub/TrainingPlans/NikePlusRunClub_HalfMarathon-Training-Plan7_8_2015.pdf"> here </a>.
            <li> My personal training hint - get up t 10 miles injury-free.
              Once you can run 10 miles, you can run a half.</li>
            <li> Average Cost: $95.</li>
          </ul>
        <li> Marathon (26.2 miles) </li>
        <ul class="sub-list">
          <li> THE race on most runners bucket list.</li>
          <li> An amazing opportunity and feeling when you finish your first -
            you will wow your friends - soak it up, you deserve it!</li>
          <li> Training (3-4 mo) will be much different than your regular routine.
            Long runs may affect your regular routine, and you will need to eat and sleep more.</li>
          <li> A good training schedule can be found <a href="http://content.nike.com/content/dam/one-nike/en_us/season-2015-su/Running/NikeRunClub/TrainingPlans/Marathon_Training_Plan_Miles_7_7_2015.pdf">here</a>.</li>
          <li> Average Cost: $125.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Ultra-Marathon (Varies, 26.2+ miles) </li>
        <ul class="sub-list">
          <li> I have never run an ultra, so my knowledge is limited. (Sorry!)</li>
          <li> 50K Average Cost: $90.</li>
          <li> 100K Average Cost: $165.</li>
          <li> 100mi Average Cost: $180.</li>
